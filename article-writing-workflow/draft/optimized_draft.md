# Spontaneous Solo Trip Gone Wrong: An Unforgettable Adventure

I decided to go on a solo travel trip because everyone said it was good for self-discovery, and honestly, I was bored at home and work was driving me crazy. So, without thinking much, I booked my ticket. I didn't even check the weather or pack properly; all I threw in my bag were some shirts and a pair of flip-flops.

My train journey was too long, and the seat was not comfortable, and the guy next to me was snoring so loud that it felt like he needed his nose checked. I tried to sleep but then a baby started crying, which ruined my chances of any shut-eye. When I reached my destination (I forgot its name now), I had no plan - zero. So, I just wandered wherever looked nice.

I saw a beach but it was closed or under construction, and there was a dog there who we vibed with for 5 minutes before he ran away. Then, I bought coconut water, but the guy gave no straw, and it spilled on my shirt, making me look like a wet sock all day. I tried to find a hotel, but there was no internet, so I asked an old lady nearby who yelled at me first because I said “yo” instead of “hello.”

Later, she directed me towards rooms, but they were full. Eventually, I found a hostel with bunk beds and about 7 people in one room, and the fan was broken, but they gave me a towel for free, so I was like cool. The other people were from different countries; I didn't talk much because my English felt shy. But one guy had a guitar and played music that sounded nice, so I nodded along.

The next day, I woke up late and missed the sunrise that everyone was excited about online. I ate local food which was some rice dish with spicy sauce but tasted good, despite making my eyes water. Then, I tried to rent a scooter but forgot my license; oops! The guy still gave it to me after I said I knew how to ride and showed him my bike wallpaper on my phone.

I drove around a lot and got lost twice. I met an old man who spoke in a language I didn't understand, but somehow he pointed me back to the road using stick and noises. Really kind of him. I ran out of petrol once and had to push my bike for a bit until I found a small shop where I bought coke and sat there for an hour thinking about why I was even there and other stuff.

The last day, it rained like crazy, so I stayed in the hostel all day just chilling with strangers who were playing cards that I didn't understand. Still, I laughed when they laughed. My clothes were wet because I had no time to dry them, and I caught a cold on my way back. But overall, it was okay; I didn’t “find myself” or anything like that, but it was something different from my normal boring life, so yeah. Maybe I'll go again someday with a little more planning and shoes that don't suck.
