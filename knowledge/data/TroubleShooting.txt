1. Dashboard says "No data found"
    * Cause: This usually happens when the integration with your feedback source is disrupted.
    * Solution:
        * Go to Settings > Integrations and check the status of your active integrations (e.g., Intercom, Google Forms).
        * Reconnect or reauthenticate the integration by following the integration steps again.

2. Sentiment analysis seems inaccurate
    * Cause: The sentiment model might be misinterpreting certain phrases, especially if they contain sarcasm or colloquialisms.
    * Solution:
        * Manually tag a sample set of feedback to train the model.
        * Use the Feedback Calibration tool in Settings to improve sentiment accuracy over time.

3. Trouble connecting to Zendesk
    * Cause: The Zendesk API key might be invalid or the required permissions aren't granted.
    * Solution:
        * Check the API settings in your Zendesk account.
        * In Settings > Integrations, disconnect and reconnect the integration.
        * Ensure that you have the correct API permissions to access tickets and feedback.

4. Export issues
    * Cause: Large export files or temporary connectivity issues might prevent downloads.
    * Solution:
        * Try exporting data in smaller chunks or with a limited date range.
        * If exporting large files, use a faster internet connection or try again at a different time.
