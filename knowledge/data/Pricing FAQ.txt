How do I know which plan to choose?

If you're just starting and need basic insights, the Starter plan is great. If you handle a moderate amount of feedback daily, the Pro plan will scale with your business needs. If you're handling a vast amount of feedback or require custom integrations, the Enterprise plan will be ideal.

Can I upgrade/downgrade at any time?

Yes! You can switch plans at any time. For example, if you're growing rapidly, you can move to the Pro or Enterprise plan, and your billing cycle will adjust accordingly.

Do you offer discounts for annual billing?

Yes! If you choose to pay for the Pro plan annually, youâ€™ll receive 2 months free (equivalent to 16 months for the price of 12).
